# TicTacToe
A simple TicTacToe game that allows users to play locally or online. The game will allow a player to have a profile through the Apple Game Center and will display the players online hi-score via a score board system. This system will be able to be seen online by other plays. The user can choose to play against an AI as a single player function, a pass and play option between two players, or online play.

# Motivation
This project exists because I love the idea of others enjoying something I have created. Though it is a simple TicTacToe game I believe there is much fun to be had in the simple things. This project has also taught me much about creating an iOS application, linking application with Google Fire Base, and working with simulators in Xcode.

# Build Status
The current project builds, but the online functionality and AI are not working at this point.

# Code Style
This project is written in Swift.

# Tech Used
Built and tested inside of Xcode.
